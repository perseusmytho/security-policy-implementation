<h1>🔒 Implementing an IT Security Policy</h1>

<h2>📌 Overview</h2>
This project focuses on **implementing IT security policies** to enforce **password policies, antivirus protection, mobile device security, and Windows security baselines**. It also includes **Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) and privacy policies** to define security best practices.

<h2>🛠 Tools & Technologies Used</h2>

- **Active Directory Group Policy (GPOs)** – Enforcing security settings  
- **Windows Defender Policies** – Antivirus and real-time protection configurations  
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** – Securing remote devices  
- **Security Baselines** – Applying Microsoft's recommended security policies  

<h2>🔍 Key Policies Implemented</h2>

| Security Policy | Description | Implementation |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Password Protection Policy** | Enforces password complexity and expiration rules. | Configured **Active Directory GPO** for domain-wide enforcement. |
| **Antivirus & Real-Time Protection** | Ensures all endpoints have active malware protection. | Deployed **Windows Defender policies** via Group Policy. |
| **Windows Security Baseline** | Applies recommended security configurations. | Linked **MSDomainSecurity2019 object** to enforce security baselines. |
| **Mobile Device Security** | Enforces encryption, updates, and remote management. | Configured **Google Play Protect, device encryption, and Find My Device**. |

<h2>✅ Security Best Practices & Key Takeaways</h2>

🔹 **Enforcing strong password policies** reduces the risk of credential-based attacks.  
🔹 **Antivirus policies** help prevent malware infections and unauthorized software execution.  
🔹 **Mobile device security** is essential for protecting remote and BYOD users.  
🔹 **Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs)** define clear security expectations for employees.
